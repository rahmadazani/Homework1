                <p>I got bachelor degree form Brawijaya University in Economic development majoring and graduated with
                    GPA 3.69 of 4.00. After graduated I am working as Product Marketing at Kitabisa.com. <br><br>

                    Kitabisa is a crowdfunding platform which has a mission to channel kindness and help everyone to
                    create a better world to each other. As a product marketing I also have responsibilities to get the
                    leads numbers of our donors then convert them to be our active members to donate in our platform and
                    make them feel satisfying of our product especially in my task in Donasi Rutin (Autodebet product of
                    Kitabisa). <br><br>

                    I am also interested in being an MC, Radio Announcer or anything about public speaking because in
                    the university I am frequently being an MC in university events or government events in my
                    university. So for now I open for the opportunity to get a side job as MC or radio announcer.

                    Thank You! </p>
